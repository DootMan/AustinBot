# AustinBot
A discord bot that does some things.

This bot is a working in progress, currently working on polishing the existing commands so I can add new ones.

Commands:
-	$help: Displays a currently unhelpful help message.
-	$markov: Generates a random sentence using markov chains.
-	$chicken: BrraaWWK
-	$twitter: Post a tweet to the bots twitter account
-	$twitterdirect: Sends a message to a user on twitter.
-	$cat: Post a picture of a cat.
-	$rr: Russian roulette.
-	$dice: Roll a dice.

# Dependencies
-	Twitter API wrapper(https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter)
-	Markovify(https://github.com/jsvine/markovify)
-	Cat Api Wrapper(https://github.com/gravmatt/random-cat)
-	discord API(https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
-	requests(https://github.com/requests/requests)
-	That *should* be all the dependencies you have to install, the rest should be installed already, if they are not then check the error logs and check which modules are missing.

# Setup

Make sure you have the dependencies installed, make sure you have your api keys in the correct places.

For the markov command to work it needs a text file, the bigger the better. I have provided one made of copypastas from reddit.(Consider reading the Markovify.py github page for more info.)
